                    <h3>What is the Decathlon</h3>
                    <p>
                        The decathlon is a two-day track-and-field competition made up of 
                        ten events that test speed, strength, endurance, and skill across sprints, 
                        jumps, throws, and a middle-distance run. Combining these diverse challenges 
                        into a single contest, the decathlon is widely regarded as the ultimate 
                        measure of all-around athletic ability. Since its debut at the 1912 Stockholm 
                        Olympics, where Jim Thorpe claimed the first gold, the Olympic decathlon 
                        champion has traditionally been honored with the unofficial but prestigious 
                        title of “World’s Greatest Athlete.”
                    </p>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        The modern decathlon was introduced at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, inspired 
                        by ancient Greek multi-event contests that tested a wide range of athletic 
                        skills. That year, American Jim Thorpe dominated the inaugural competition, 
                        setting a high standard and earning lasting fame. Over the decades, the event 
                        has evolved in scoring methods and training techniques but has consistently 
                        served as the benchmark for all-around athletic excellence, with champions 
                        from Bruce Jenner in 1976 to Ashton Eaton in the 2010.
